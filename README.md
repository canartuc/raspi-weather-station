# raspi-weather-station

## Aim of the Project

My weather station broke, and I wanted to develop something for Rasperry Pi with an integrated screen. I haven't 
developed something for Raspi with Go programming language and used an integrated screen for it so it will be fun
to try. If you need something similar and would like to track weather, date and time without using mobile phone, you
are in a right place :) You can customize your own project by building and HTML file in `templates` . I will write 
better documentation when I completed the project and have the first working version.
